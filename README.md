What I want my fitness tracker to do:

	1) You're able to:
	-Enter Your Weight
	-Enter Your Goal Weight
	-How many months you want to take to lose the weight

	2) Based on what they entered it will show them how many their calorie intake for the day

	3) Then they will be able to enter the amount of calories they ate and how many calories they burned from exercise daily

	4) From all of this it should tell your weekly progress (if you lost or gained weight) and then eventually youll hopefully hit your goal weight

Extra Features of my fitness tracker:

	1) Show recipes for different healthy meal options
	
	2) Show different types of excercise options
	
	3) Maybe a supplement page for healthy boosts getting healthy and losing weight
